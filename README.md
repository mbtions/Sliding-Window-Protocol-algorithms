## What is Sliding Window Protocol ?

  A sliding window protocol is a feature of packet-based data transmission protocols. 
  Sliding window protocols are used where reliable in-order delivery of packets is required, 
  such as in the data link layer (OSI layer 2) as well as in the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).
